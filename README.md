How It Works
 Entry Point

The website starts from index.html, which acts as the main entry point.

 CSS Architecture
base.css
Contains global styles
Navbar, footer, buttons
CSS variables (colors, fonts, spacing)
Page-specific CSS
Each page has its own stylesheet
Keeps code clean and modular
Avoids unnecessary CSS loading
 Layout System
CSS Grid
Used for major layouts (hero section, sections with multiple columns)
Flexbox
Used for smaller layouts (navbar, buttons, rows)
 Responsive Design
Media queries at:
880px
560px
Features:
Layout stacks on smaller screens
Navbar becomes hamburger menu
Content adapts for mobile usability
 JavaScript Functionality (app.js)

The entire interactivity is handled by a single JavaScript file.

1️⃣ Navbar Scroll Effect
Adds shadow when user scrolls
Improves visual feedback
2️⃣ Mobile Navigation
Hamburger menu opens full-screen panel
Functions used:
openMenu()
closeMenu()
3️⃣ Scroll Reveal Animation
Uses IntersectionObserver
Adds .visible class when elements enter viewport
More efficient than scroll event listeners
4️⃣ Services Accordion
Expand/collapse service sections
Controlled via toggleSvc() function
5️⃣ Contact Form Validation
Checks required fields (name, email)
Shows:
Error messages
Success message
Resets form after submission
 Design Features
Clean and modern UI
Google Fonts:
Space Grotesk (body)
Lora (headings)
Consistent color system using CSS variables
